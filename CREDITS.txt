All source code was done by myself (IAmTheIssue).

Most textures where drawn with GIMP (again, by myself).
https://www.gimp.org/
Some of them are based on those from the original game.

Some textures* where copied from a mod called "Realistic Animal Products And Drops" by Sargeant_789575 - 
with friendly permission from himself to use them. If you like my mod, definitely check out his:

I'm not sure where I got raw_horse_meat.png from (found via google image search).
If you're the author, and you would like me to remove this texture from my mod, please
message me - I'll gladly follow your wish.
cooked_horse_meat.png was done by myself, but is obviously based on the raw version.
